# MuteAnnoyingSounds
Mute annoying in-game sounds
This is a simple addon that mutes annoying in-game sounds such as toys, mounts, footsteps, and many more

**There are some noticeable sounds that you may not want muted!**
* Friend joins game
* Level Up
* Ready Check and Dungeon Queue

If you want to enable any of these sounds you must edit "MuteSoundFile.lua" and comment out any you wish to unmute by using two dashes "--" or deleting the line
